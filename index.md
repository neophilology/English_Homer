# English Homer
*Daniel Barrera, 21/12/2024*

Discover the intersection of Homeric tradition in English literature and digital humanities. This site explores translations, adaptations, and intertextual dialogues with the Greek Bard—–the "English Homer." By applying data science methods and data visualization to literary texts, I aim to uncover new insights into the rich tapestry of Homeric influence.

The Homeric legacy in English is vast and profound. This ongoing research began during my graduate studies at the University of Tübingen and continues to evolve.
